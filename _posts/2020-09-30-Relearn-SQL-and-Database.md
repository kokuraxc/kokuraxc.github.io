> Track how I refresh my database knowledge

Itâ€™s been over two years, but I still recall clearly how I couldnâ€™t explain clearly to the interviews the benefits of using [views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_(SQL)) over tables in database design. This is one of the reasons why Iâ€™m re-picking up this field again, the other reason being that Iâ€™m learning machine learning and data science now.

After a few Google search, I settled on quickly reading through these two books first. _**Getting Started with SQL**_ by Thomas Nield and _**Practical SQL**_ by _Anthony DeBarros_.

I borrowed these two books from OverDrive using my library account, and loaded them into my Kobo Forma ebook reader. Here we go.
