> Track how I refresh my database knowledge

Itâ€™s been over two years, but I still recall clearly how I couldnâ€™t explain clearly to the interviews the benefits of using [views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_(SQL)) over tables in database design. This is one of the reasons why Iâ€™m re-picking up this field again, the other reason being that Iâ€™m learning machine learning and data science now.

After a few Google search, I settled on quickly reading through these two books first. _**Getting Started with SQL**_ by Thomas Nield and _**Practical SQL**_ by _Anthony DeBarros_.

I borrowed these two books from OverDrive using my library account, and loaded them into my Kobo Forma ebook reader. Here we go.

From the contents of the book, it should be easy to read through. Letâ€™s see what Iâ€™ll think of after finish it.

Finished the _**Getting Started with SQL**_ yesterday. It's quite a smooth read. Contents are clearly explained, and easy to follow.

Later I'll start the second book _**Practical SQL**_. Hope I can learn more from this book, especially what's missing in the first one, like `indexes`, `triggers`, etc.

This week I completed a job-related task to make an SQL query into a MySQL database, calculating the inventory stock shortage for every product in every warehouse.

The logic sounds clear. But the database is not carefully designed, the relations among tables a little bit messy. I foresaw it wouldn't be easy to tackle this problem. Luckily my recently acquired knowledge on SQL helped a lot.
