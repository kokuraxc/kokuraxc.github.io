## Chapter 1: Probability

### 1.1 Introduction
Probability is a mathematical language for quantifying uncertainty.

### 1.2 Sample Spaces and Events

- $\Omega$: sample space
- points $\omega$ in $\Omega$: sample outcomes, realizations, or elements
- $A$: event, subset of $\Omega$
- $A^c$: complement of $A$ (not $A$)
- $A \cup B$: union ($A$ or $B$)
- $A \cap B$ or $AB$: intersection ($A$ and $B$)
- $A - B$: set difference ($\omega$ in $A$ but not in $B$)
- $A \subset B$: set inclusion
- $\emptyset$: null event (always false)
- $\Omega$: true event (always true)

> Examples: 

If we toss a coin twice, then $\Omega = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$. The events that the first toss is head is $A = \{HH, HT\}$.

There is usually no harm in taking the sample space to be larger than needed.
