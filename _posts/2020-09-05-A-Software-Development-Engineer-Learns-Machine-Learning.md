> The journey of how I am switching my track to data scientist in the mid-career

Iâ€™ve been interested in machine learning and data science for quite a while, but never really dived into the field to understand thoroughly how they work.


Recently I watched a few YouTube videos by Daniel Bourke on how he self-learnt himself from knowing nothing about machine learning to a machine learning engineer, and even built a machine learning course. The story is motivating and it helped me remember the ambition Iâ€™ve been holding down.


Iâ€™ve always wanted to become a data scientist, but refrained from trying because I didnâ€™t learn it in my university time and I assumed it would be too difficult for me to master it.


I guess nothing would be difficult if you work hard enough.


Iâ€™m setting off on the journey of becoming a data scientist now. And Iâ€™ll keep the journal here.

Iâ€™ve started reading the book *Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by *Aurelien Geron*. Iâ€™ll update my progress here frequently.

- [x] Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape ðŸš© *[Completed on Sep 10, 2020]* (Now I understand how hard it is to keep on learning while working on a full time job. This week job was busy; I hardly had time for Andrewâ€™s Machine Learning course. Luckily I always read some pages of the book while in bed before going to sleep. Thus had this chapter finished last night. Yeah! As I was starting out with both the book and the course at the same time, I can find some similar concepts in both sources. Itâ€™s kind of reinforcing my understanding of the field.)

One of the most recommended courses on Coursera is Machine Learning by Andrew Ng. It has been available online for many years. Now Iâ€™m getting down to taking on the course.

- [x] Week 1 ðŸš©[Completed on Sep 06, 2020]
  * Introduction
  * Linear Regression with One Variable
  * Linear Algebra Review
- [x] Week 2 ðŸš©[Completed on Sep 12, 2020] [Weekends are the best! I finally had the luxury of time to catch up with the study. Today I spent five and a half hours on Week 2 and completed all the lectures and assignments!]
  * Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
  * Octave/Matlab Tutorial
- [x] Week 3ðŸš©[Completed on Sep 26, 2020]
  * Logistic Regression
  * Regularization
- [x] Week 4ðŸš©[Completed on Sep 29, 2020] [I took one day off for this yearâ€™s birthday leave on Monday (Sep 28), and made use of the these two days (Sunday and Monday) to complete week 4â€™s lesson. Monday felt so good when I ignored all the work related emails and WhatsApp messages, just focusing on Andrewâ€™s lecture videos. Iâ€™m already looking forward to the next off day now.]
  * Neural Networks: Representation
- [x] Week 5ðŸš©[Completed on Oct 3, 2020] [Following the equations, I successfully implemented the functions in MatLab. But I need to go through more iterations on the fundamental concepts to fully understand them. Luckily there are enough online courses available now. Iâ€™ve already saved a few for future learning.]
  * Neural Networks: Learning
- [x] Week 6ðŸš©[Completed on Oct 10, 2020] 
  * Advice for Applying Machine Learning
  * Machine Learning System Design
- [ ] Week 7ðŸ‘ˆ
  * Support Vector Machines
- [ ] Week 8
  * Unsupervised Learning
  * Dimensionality Reduction
- [ ] Week 9
  * Anomaly Detection
  * Recommender Systems
- [ ] Week 10
  * Large Scale Machine Learning
- [ ] Week 11
  * Application Example: Photo OCR

Back in the old middle school days, I was still good and math and numbers. But ever since I got into university, I let myself loose on this subject. And I have this secret fear of math, and am afraid of not capable of tackling any math problems that have equations in them. I started out with ML like this.


Week 3 of ML course was tough. I worked hard to follow the contents of the lectures. And the assignments of converting the math equations into Matlab codes almost dazed me. Luckily and surprisingly I completely all the assignments! Yeaahh!

The hardest part is getting started. Now that Iâ€™m on track already, Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll be OK!

Fighting! âœŠ

There is a 2-day rule to follow while building a habit, of which you should avoid missing your daily habit two days in a row. Otherwise, you may risk losing the momentum of keeping with the habit.

This week the same thing happened to my ML course: I didn't pick up the course material for four consecutive days, to such an extent that I thought I would miss this week's assignment deadline.

Lucily deep down I knew that I have to do this, to finish the course. The determination won over the fear of the imagined difficulty of ML.

Week 6 was conquered. And I, should never lose faith in myself.
